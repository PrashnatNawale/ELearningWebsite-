                <p>The pandemic led to a large number of small-scale businesses being shut down resulting in people losing their jobs. At the same time, multinational corporations too suffered a lot with businesses receiving a no-go for foreign transactions.Even

                    We bring you 5 must-have skills to elevate your career in the post-pandemic period.</p>
                <h1>Interpersonal Skills</h1>
                <p>Your career isn't only about performing your job well. It is also evaluated on the way you interact with people. Working in a company means that you will be working in teams where you may communicate through our verbal and non-verbal communication.
                    Therefore, it is important that you possess or build strong interpersonal skills as a lack of the same could lead to conflicts between colleagues. A few must have interpersonal skills include active listening skills, body language,
                    tolerance, and empathy.</p>

                <h1>Communication</h1>
                <p><strong>“Take advantage of every opportunity to practice your communication skills so that when important occasions arise, you will have the gift, the style, the sharpness, the clarity, and the emotions to affect other people.” - Jim Rohn, Entrepreneur, Author and Motivational Speaker</strong></p>
                <br>
                <p>Communication isn't performed only through the act of speaking. It is also done via observation and a keen sense of listening to the opposite individual. Similar to other skills, communication skills too can be enhanced over time. You
                    can be a good communicator by being a patient listener and empathizing with the speaker. Now that most of our communication has been shifted to the virtual world, instead of performing it as a face to face interaction, good communication
                    skills are even more critical. You can either take a communication class to brush up your existing communication skills or to imbibe them from scratch. This is one skill that will take you very far in your career</p>
